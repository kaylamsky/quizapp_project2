Team Members Role: 
Kayla Motiram 
- server.js: starts the server, sends pages to the browser, sends random questions from the questions.json file to the browser, checks the users answers and sends the score
- updated my partners arrow function "onclick" function in script.js to add features such as sound for correct and wrong answers, and changing the color of the answer choice depending if its right or wrong, and always displaying the correct answer in green if a wrong answer was chosen
- updated script.js so that it works directly with server.js for example the server routes, /questions in script.js is getting the questions from the questions.json file
- contributed to style.css
  
Haneen Mustafa
- script.js: displays one question at a time with multiple choice options, tracks user answers and disables the inputs after selection, adds a 30-second timer per question with a visual progress bar, auto-skips unanswered questions displayed "Time's up"
- created the different pages by created separate html files like results.html, quiz.html and index.html
- contributed to style.css 
- created both pages profile.html and Leaderboard.html
- I worked on the API part of the project. I created a new route called /questions in our server.js file. This route gets 10 random multiple-choice questions from the Open Trivia Database API. It mixes the answers and puts them into A, B, C, and D choices. It also sends the right answer so the quiz can check if the player is correct. This way, the quiz has new questions every time someone plays.
